# Epistemic Saturation in Closed Systems a simple idea

This project investigates the fundamental epistemological limits of **closed knowledge systems** using symbolic vector models, linear transformations, and semantic equivalence classes. The work formalizes how internal discovery in such systems becomes saturated, and under which conditions new conceptual structures require **external intervention**.

## üîç Core Idea: Closed Epistemic Systems

We define a **closed system** as one in which:
- All conceptual knowledge is encoded as symbolic vectors in a finite-dimensional space,
- Chunk our way to see the world, ie, the symbols that compose rules of things and try to apply math on it
    - a vector is a representation of this process of chunking with its components
- Transformations are performed by a fixed linear epistemic matrix \( A \),
- Semantic output is activated through nonlinear functions (e.g., sigmoid),
- Novelty is limited to **combinations** of known concepts.

Without changing the transformation matrix or expanding the vector space, **no genuinely new concept can be discovered**.

## üìê Linear Tools

- **Concepts** are represented as vectors
- **Knowledge** is represented via a linear transformation \( f(v) = Av \)
- **Activation** is modeled by sigmoid \( \sigma(Av) \) for bounded semantic intensity
- **Discovery** is interpreted as the ability to distinguish new semantic vectors

## üß† Semantic Equivalence

We define a semantic equivalence relation:

`v‚ÇÅ ~ v‚ÇÇ ‚áî f(v‚ÇÅ) = f(v‚ÇÇ)`

This means the system cannot distinguish `v‚ÇÅ` from `v‚ÇÇ`: they are **epistemically equivalent**.

#### Example:
- `v‚ÇÉ = [0, 0, 1, 0, ..., 0]`
- `v·¥µ·¥µ·¥µ = [0.5, 0.5, ..., 0.5]`

If both result in the same semantic activation, then:

`v‚ÇÉ ~ v·¥µ·¥µ·¥µ`

## üß™ Code and Simulation

The repository includes:
- Python simulations of activation, equivalence, and expansion
- Demonstrations of concept collapse
- External interventions (fine-tuning and matrix expansion)
- Visual comparisons of sigmoid-based epistemic outputs

## üìö Theoretical Context

The approach draws from:
- incompleteness in formal systems
- paradigm shifts and discovery

## üìò Next Steps

- Extend from linear algebra to **topological epistemics**
- Formalize **emergent concepts** via open sets and limit points
